1)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


HTTP/1.1 has been around for more than a decade.
With Google’s SPDY leading the way in 2015, the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) gave us HTTP/2, 
which introduces several features to reduce page load times.
Let’s compare HTTP2 Vs. HTTP1.1 in detail.


HTTP/2 achieves faster webpage loading without performance optimizations that require extensive human efforts in terms of development.
It significantly reduces the complexities that had crept into HTTP/1.1 and gives us a 
robust protocol which,though not without its flaws, will perhaps stand the test of time. 
Before making this leap forward, let’s trace our steps back to when the internet
was in its infancy to understand how the different versions evolved into the current form.
